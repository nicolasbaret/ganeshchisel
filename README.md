### Dependencies

#### JDK 11 or newer

We recommend using Java 11 or later LTS releases. While Chisel itself works with Java 8, our preferred build tool Mill requires Java 11. You can install the JDK as your operating system recommends, or use the prebuilt binaries from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) (formerly AdoptOpenJDK).

#### SBT or mill

SBT is the most common build tool in the Scala community. You can download it [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).
Mill is another Scala/Java build tool preferred by Chisel's developers.
This repository includes a bootstrap script `./mill` so that no installation is necessary.
You can read more about Mill on its website: https://mill-build.org.

#### Verilator

The test with `svsim` needs Verilator installed.
See Verilator installation instructions [here](https://verilator.org/guide/latest/install.html).

### How to get started

You can run the included test with:
```sh
sbt test
```

Alternatively, if you use Mill:
```sh
./mill %NAME%.test
```

You should see a whole bunch of output that ends with something like the following lines
```
[info] Tests: succeeded 1, failed 0, canceled 0, ignored 0, pending 0
[info] All tests passed.
[success] Total time: 5 s, completed Dec 16, 2020 12:18:44 PM
```
If you see the above then...

### It worked!

You are ready to go. We have a few recommended practices and things to do.

* Use packages and following conventions for [structure](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Directories.html) and [naming](http://docs.scala-lang.org/style/naming-conventions.html)
* Package names should be clearly reflected in the testing hierarchy
* Build tests for all your work
* Read more about testing in SBT in the [SBT docs](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Testing.html)
* This template includes a [test dependency](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Library-Dependencies.html#Per-configuration+dependencies) on [ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/). This, coupled with `svsim` (included with Chisel) and `verilator`, are a starting point for testing Chisel generators.
  * You can remove this dependency in the build.sbt file if you want to
* Change the name of your project in the build.sbt file
* Change your README.md
